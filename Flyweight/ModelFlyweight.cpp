/**
 * Flyweight Design Pattern
 * 
 * In this example, a 3D scene creation software is shown. It can create thousands of objects such as trees, 
 * houses, etc. In order to reduce memeory usage, the common (intrisic) attributes of the objects are modeled 
 * as Flyweight, such as color, texture. The individual (extrinsic) attributes are modeled as unique states, 
 * such as position, size, etc.
